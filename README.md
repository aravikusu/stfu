# STFU
A FFXI Windower addon that allows you add terms to a blacklist and then have the addon automatically blacklist anyone who says those words.

The primary usage here is to silence RMT spam inside of city states. I find them annoying. You probably do too. 

Commands STFU supports:
- `add`/`a [WORDS]` - add a word (or multiple) to the blacklist.
- `remove`/`r`/`rm [WORDS]` - remove a word (or multiple) from the blacklist.
- `list`/`l`/`ls` - list every word that you've added to the blacklist.
- `help`/`h` - general info and command list.
